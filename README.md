# Retail-Shop-Case-Study
## Goal
Develop a database to analyze and visualize retail shopping data. Specifically:
- link sales data with weather patterns and survey demographics
- Identify correlations: temperature vs. sales, rainfall effects, weekend lift.
- Compare shop performance and seasonal patterns.
- Build foundation for dashboards and predictive modeling.
## Research questions / problems
Daily sales fluctuate and leadership lacks clarity on why. Understanding how the weather and customer demographics impact performance will provide insights to improve planning, staffing, and promotions.
1. How strongly do temperature and rainfall affect daily sales?
2. Which shop performs best, and why?
3. Who are our customers — families vs singles, male vs female — and how does this change over time?
4. Are there predictable seasonal patterns in sales?
## Summary 
1. Gather and clean daily sales, weather, and survey data. (Build a Database)
2. Join datasets on date for unified analysis.
3. Explore descriptive statistics and visualizations. (Analyze Data)
4. Create Power BI dashboards for stakeholders.
## Recommendations / answer to research questions
Sales are shaped by weather, location, and customer mix. To maximize growth, managers must adapt operations to seasonal shifts and customer patterns.
